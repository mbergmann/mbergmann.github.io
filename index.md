#### [news.ninemsn.com.au](http://news.ninemsn.com.au)
In October 2012 we launched Australia's biggest news site written in ASP.NET MVC3 hosted on Amazon.
In this project I championed the Release Management of the CMS and news site, working closely with the Operations and the Lead Architect to achieve Continues Delivery.
During the news and in a true DevOps fashion we automated everything from the infrastructure setup to push button deployments of the application, while still managing to being highly available.
As part of this project we implemented a Package Manager for windows, written in .NET to rollout IIS Websites and Windows Services using AWS S3 as a distribution method and Powershell to install the payloads.

#### Mobile Advertising
I was part of a small team developing .NET for a mobile marketing and advertising web platform.
