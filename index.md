`Engineering Team`

At ninemsn I was the Lead Developer for automation, infrastructure as code and release management related challenges. My recent project was to fully automate the infrastructure hosting a high volume website, including launching and bootstrapping over 30 EC2 instances using AWS Ruby’s SDK, Puppet, Powershell and bash.

`CMS Team`

In October 2012 we launched Australia's biggest [news](http://news.ninemsn.com.au) site written in ASP.NET MVC3 hosted on Amazon, the site currently handles over 10 million unique users per month.

In this project I championed the release management of the CMS and the news website, working closely with the operations team and the lead architect of the project to achieve continues delivery and infrastructure as code.

I also worked on functional features, i.e. developing end user components of the news website, fully test driven using MVC3.

During the project the DevOps movement came to life which allowed us to automate everything from the infrastructure setup to push button deployments of the application, while still being highly available.
As part of this project we implemented a package manager for windows, written in .NET to rollout IIS websites, databases and windows services using AWS S3 as a distribution method and PowerShell to install the packages.


`Mobile Advertising`

I was part of a small team developing .NET for a mobile marketing and advertising web platform.
During this time I implemented custom solutions for the platform i.e. online and offline data report generation of SMS campaigns using various charting, introduced parallel processing of large data imports.

`Content Syndication`

In the content syndication development team my role was to identify and understand the needs of internal and external customers.
Part of my role was to develop a content management module for video on demand schedules covering the schedule ingestion, management and syndication using jQuery UI and drag & drop.
