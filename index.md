In October 2012 we launched Australia's biggest [news](http://news.ninemsn.com.au) site written in ASP.NET MVC3 hosted on Amazon, the site currently handles over 10 million unique users per month.

During the project the DevOps movement came to life which allowed us to automate everything from the infrastructure setup to push button deployments of the application, while still being highly available.
